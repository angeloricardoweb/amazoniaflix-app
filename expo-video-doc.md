# Video (expo-video)

_A library that provides an API to implement video playback in apps._

Available on platforms android, ios, web, tvos

`expo-video` is a cross-platform, performant video component for React Native and Expo with Web support.

#### Known issues&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['android']} />

When two [`VideoView`](#videoview) components are overlapping and have the [`contentFit`](#contentfit) prop set to [`cover`](#videocontentfit), one of the videos may be displayed out of bounds. This is a [known upstream issue](https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/1107). To work around this issue, use the [`surfaceType`](#surfacetype) prop and set it to [`textureView`](#surfacetype-1).

## Installation

```bash
$ npx expo install expo-video
```

If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, make sure to install `expo` in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-video` using its built-in [config plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/) if you use config plugins in your project ([EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use EAS Build, then you'll need to manually configure the package.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-video",
        {
          "supportsBackgroundPlayback": true,
          "supportsPictureInPicture": true
        }
      ]
    ],
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties
| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supportsBackgroundPlayback` | `undefined` | A boolean value to enable background playback support. If `true`, on iOS, the `audio` key is added to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in the **Info.plist** file. If `false`, the key is removed. When `undefined`, the key is not modified. On Android, when `true` adds foreground service permissions and creates a expo-video foreground service in AndroidManifest.xml. |
| `supportsPictureInPicture` | `undefined` | A boolean value to enable Picture-in-Picture on Android and iOS. If `true`, enables the `android:supportsPictureInPicture` property on Android and adds the `audio` key to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in the **Info.plist** file on iOS. If `false`, the key is removed. When `undefined`, the configuration is not modified. |

## Usage

Here's a simple example of a video with a play and pause button.

```jsx
import { useEvent } from 'expo';
import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video';
import { StyleSheet, View, Button } from 'react-native';

const videoSource =
  'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4';

export default function VideoScreen() {
  const player = useVideoPlayer(videoSource, player => {
    player.loop = true;
    player.play();
  });

  const { isPlaying } = useEvent(player, 'playingChange', { isPlaying: player.playing });

  return (
    <View style={styles.contentContainer}>
      <VideoView style={styles.video} player={player} allowsFullscreen allowsPictureInPicture />
      <View style={styles.controlsContainer}>
        <Button
          title={isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
          onPress={() => {
            if (isPlaying) {
              player.pause();
            } else {
              player.play();
            }
          }}
        />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  contentContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 10,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    paddingHorizontal: 50,
  },
  video: {
    width: 350,
    height: 275,
  },
  controlsContainer: {
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Receiving events

The changes in properties of the [`VideoPlayer`](#videoplayer) do not update the React state. Therefore, to display the information about the current state of the `VideoPlayer`, it is necessary to listen to the [events](#videoplayerevents) it emits.
The event system is based on the [`EventEmitter`](../sdk/expo/#eventemitter) class and [hooks](../sdk/expo/#hooks) from the [`expo`](../sdk/expo) package. There are a few ways to listen to events:

#### `useEvent` hook

Creates a listener that will return a stateful value that can be used in a component. It also cleans up automatically when the component unmounts.

```tsx useEvent
import { useEvent } from 'expo';
// ... Other imports, definition of the component, creating the player etc.

const { status, error } = useEvent(player, 'statusChange', { status: player.status });
// Rest of the component...
```

#### `useEventListener` hook

Built around the `Player.addListener` and `Player.removeListener` methods, creates an event listener with automatic cleanup.

```tsx useEventListener
import { useEventListener } from 'expo';
// ...Other imports, definition of the component, creating the player etc.

useEventListener(player, 'statusChange', ({ status, error }) => {
  setPlayerStatus(status);
  setPlayerError(error);
  console.log('Player status changed: ', status);
});
// Rest of the component...
```

#### `Player.addListener` method

Most flexible way to listen to events, but requires manual cleanup and more boilerplate code.

```tsx Player.addListener
// ...Imports, definition of the component, creating the player etc.

useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = player.addListener('statusChange', ({ status, error }) => {
    setPlayerStatus(status);
    setPlayerError(error);
    console.log('Player status changed: ', status);
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.remove();
  };
}, []);
// Rest of the component...
```

### Playing local media from the assets directory

`expo-video` supports playing local media loaded using the `require` function. You can use the result as a source directly, or assign it to the `assetId` parameter of a [`VideoSource`](#videosource) if you also want to configure other properties.

```tsx Playing local media
import { VideoSource } from 'expo-video';

const assetId = require('./assets/bigbuckbunny.mp4');

const videoSource: VideoSource = {
  assetId,
  metadata: {
    title: 'Big Buck Bunny',
    artist: 'The Open Movie Project',
  },
};

const player1 = useVideoPlayer(assetId); // You can use the `asset` directly as a video source
const player2 = useVideoPlayer(videoSource);
```

### Playing media from the media library

`expo-video` supports playing videos picked from user's media library using [`expo-media-library`](../sdk/media-library/) or any valid `PHAsset` URI with appropriate permissions.

To play a video from the media library, you should obtain an [`Asset`](../sdk/asset/#asset) object with [`MediaLibrary.getAssetsAsync()`](../sdk/media-library/#medialibrarygetassetsasyncassetsoptions) and use its [`uri`](../sdk/asset/#uri) property as the [`uri`](#videosource) of the video source.
Before playing, make sure to request the necessary permissions using [`MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync()`](../sdk/media-library/#medialibraryrequestpermissionsasyncwriteonly-granularpermissions).

On iOS make sure **not** to use the `localUri` property of the asset info, as it does not contain the necessary permissions to read the asset.

```tsx Playing media from media library
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';
import { VideoSource, useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video';

// ...Definition of the component, creating the player etc.

const loadAssetAndReplace = async () => {
  const { granted } = await MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync(false, ['video']);
  if (!granted) {
    return;
  }

  const pagedAssets = await MediaLibrary.getAssetsAsync({
    mediaType: 'video',
  });

  if (pagedAssets.assets.length > 0) {
    const [asset] = pagedAssets.assets;
    const videoSource: VideoSource = {
      uri: asset.uri,
      metadata: {
        title: asset.filename,
      },
    };

    await player.replaceAsync(videoSource);
    await player.replaceAsync(asset.uri); // Alternatively you can use the asset uri directly
    player.play();
  }
};

// You can now use loadAssetAndReplace to load and play the first video from the media library
```

### Preloading videos

While another video is playing, a video can be loaded before showing it in the view. This allows for quicker transitions between subsequent videos and a better user experience.

To preload a video, you have to create a `VideoPlayer` with a video source. Even when the player is not connected to a `VideoView`, it will fill the buffers. Once it is connected to the `VideoView`, it will be able to start playing without buffering.

In some cases, it is beneficial to preload a video later in the screen lifecycle. In that case, a `VideoPlayer` with a `null` source should be created. To start preloading, replace the player source with a video source using the `replace()` function.

Here is an example of how to preload a video:

```tsx
import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView, VideoSource } from 'expo-video';
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';

const bigBuckBunnySource: VideoSource =
  'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4';

const elephantsDreamSource: VideoSource =
  'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ElephantsDream.mp4';

export default function PreloadingVideoPlayerScreen() {
  const player1 = useVideoPlayer(bigBuckBunnySource, player => {
    player.play();
  });

  const player2 = useVideoPlayer(elephantsDreamSource, player => {
    player.currentTime = 20;
  });

  const [currentPlayer, setCurrentPlayer] = useState(player1);

  const replacePlayer = useCallback(async () => {
    currentPlayer.pause();
    if (currentPlayer === player1) {
      setCurrentPlayer(player2);
      player1.pause();
      player2.play();
    } else {
      setCurrentPlayer(player1);
      player2.pause();
      player1.play();
    }
  }, [player1, currentPlayer]);

  return (
    <View style={styles.contentContainer}>
      <VideoView player={currentPlayer} style={styles.video} nativeControls={false} />
      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={replacePlayer}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Replace Player</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  contentContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 10,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    paddingHorizontal: 50,
  },
  button: {
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    borderRadius: 3,
    paddingVertical: 8,
    paddingHorizontal: 12,
    backgroundColor: '#4630ec',
  },
  buttonText: {
    fontSize: 12,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#eeeeee',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  video: {
    width: 300,
    height: 168.75,
    marginVertical: 20,
  },
});
```

### Using the VideoPlayer directly

In most cases, the [`useVideoPlayer`](#usevideoplayersource-setup) hook should be used to create a `VideoPlayer` instance. It manages the player's lifecycle and ensures that it is properly disposed of when the component is unmounted. However, in some advanced use cases, it might be necessary to create a `VideoPlayer` that does not get automatically destroyed when the component is unmounted.
In those cases, the `VideoPlayer` can be created using the [`createVideoPlayer`](#videocreatevideoplayersource) function. You need be aware of the risks that come with this approach, as it is your responsibility to call the [`release()`](../sdk/expo/#release) method when the player is no longer needed. If not handled properly, this approach may lead to memory leaks.

```tsx Creating player instance
import { createVideoPlayer } from 'expo-video';
const player = createVideoPlayer(videoSource);
```

> **warning** On Android, mounting multiple `VideoView` components at the same time with the same `VideoPlayer` instance will not work due to a [platform limitation](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/35012).

### Caching videos

If your app frequently replays the same video, caching can be utilized to minimize network usage and enhance user experience, albeit at the cost of increased device storage usage. `expo-video` supports video caching on `Android` and `iOS` platforms. This feature can be activated by setting the [`useCaching`](#videosource) property of a [`VideoSource`](#videosource) object to `true`.

The cache is persistent and will be cleared on a least-recently-used basis once the preferred size is exceeded. Furthermore, the system can clear the cache due to low storage availability, so it's not advisable to depend on the cache to store critical data.

The cache functions offline. If a portion or the entirety of a video is cached, it can be played from the cache even when the device is offline until the cached data is exhausted.

> Due to platform limitations, the cache cannot be used with HLS video sources on iOS. Caching DRM-protected videos is not supported on Android and iOS.

### Managing the cache

- The preferred cache size in bytes can be defined using the [`setVideoCacheSizeAsync`](#videosetvideocachesizeasyncsizebytes) function. The default cache size is 1GB.
- The [`getCurrentVideoCacheSize`](#videogetcurrentvideocachesize) can be used to get the current storage occupied by the cache in bytes.
- All cached videos can be cleared using the [`clearVideoCacheAsync`](#videoclearvideocacheasync) function.

A class that represents an instance of the video player.
#### Properties
- `allowsExternalPlayback` (boolean)
  Determines whether the player should allow external playback.
  Available on platform: ios
- `audioMixingMode` (AudioMixingMode)
  Determines how the player will interact with other audio playing in the system.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `audioTrack` (null | AudioTrack)
  Specifies the audio track currently played by the player. `null` when no audio is played.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `availableAudioTracks` (AudioTrack[])

- `availableSubtitleTracks` (SubtitleTrack[])
  An array of subtitle tracks available for the current video.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `availableVideoTracks` (VideoTrack[])
  An array of video tracks available for the current video.

  > On iOS, when using a HLS source, make sure that the uri contains `.m3u8` extension or that the [`contentType`](#contenttype) property of the [`VideoSource`](#videosource) has been set to `'hls'`. Otherwise, the video tracks will not be available.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `bufferedPosition` (number)
  Float value indicating how far the player has buffered the video in seconds.

  This value is 0 when the player has not buffered up to the current playback time.
  When it's impossible to determine the buffer state (for example, when the player isn't playing any media), this value is -1.
- `bufferOptions` (BufferOptions)
  Specifies buffer options which will be used by the player when buffering the video.

  > You should provide a `BufferOptions` object when setting this property. Setting individual buffer properties is not supported.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `currentLiveTimestamp` (null | number)
  The exact timestamp when the currently displayed video frame was sent from the server,
  based on the `EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME` tag in the livestream metadata.
  If this metadata is missing, this property will return `null`.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `currentOffsetFromLive` (null | number)
  Float value indicating the latency of the live stream in seconds.
  If a livestream doesn't have the required metadata, this will return `null`.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `currentTime` (number)
  Float value indicating the current playback time in seconds.

  If the player is not yet playing, this value indicates the time position
  at which playback will begin once the `play()` method is called.

  Setting `currentTime` to a new value seeks the player to the given time.
  Note that frame accurate seeking may incur additional decoding delay which can impact seeking performance.
  Consider using the [`seekBy`](#seekbyseconds) function if the time does not have to be set precisely.
- `duration` (number)
  Float value indicating the duration of the current video in seconds.
- `isExternalPlaybackActive` (boolean)
  Indicates whether the player is currently playing back the media to an external device via AirPlay.
  Available on platform: ios
- `isLive` (boolean)
  Boolean value indicating whether the player is currently playing a live stream.
- `loop` (boolean)
  Determines whether the player should automatically replay after reaching the end of the video.
- `muted` (boolean)
  Boolean value whether the player is currently muted.
  Setting this property to `true`/`false` will mute/unmute the player.
- `playbackRate` (number)
  Float value between `0` and `16.0` indicating the current playback speed of the player.
- `playing` (boolean)
  Boolean value whether the player is currently playing.
  > Use `play` and `pause` methods to control the playback.
- `preservesPitch` (boolean)
  Boolean value indicating if the player should correct audio pitch when the playback speed changes.
- `showNowPlayingNotification` (boolean)
  Boolean value determining whether the player should show the now playing notification.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `status` (VideoPlayerStatus)
  Indicates the current status of the player.
- `staysActiveInBackground` (boolean)
  Determines whether the player should continue playing after the app enters the background.
  Available on platforms: ios, android
- `subtitleTrack` (null | SubtitleTrack)
  Specifies the subtitle track which is currently displayed by the player. `null` when no subtitles are displayed.

  > To ensure a valid subtitle track, always assign one of the subtitle tracks from the [`availableSubtitleTracks`](#availablesubtitletracks) array.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `targetOffsetFromLive` (number)
  Float value indicating the time offset from the live in seconds.
  Available on platform: ios
- `timeUpdateEventInterval` (number)
  Float value indicating the interval in seconds at which the player will emit the [`timeUpdate`](#videoplayerevents) event.
  When the value is equal to `0`, the event will not be emitted.
- `videoTrack` (null | VideoTrack)
  Specifies the video track currently played by the player. `null` when no video is displayed.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
- `volume` (number)
  Float value between `0` and `1.0` representing the current volume.
  Muting the player doesn't affect the volume. In other words, when the player is muted, the volume is the same as
  when unmuted. Similarly, setting the volume doesn't unmute the player.
#### Methods
- `addListener(eventName: EventName, listener: indexedAccess): EventSubscription`
  Adds a listener for the given event name.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `eventName` | EventName | - |
  | `listener` | indexedAccess | - |

- `emit(eventName: EventName, args: Parameters<indexedAccess>)`
  Synchronously calls all the listeners attached to that specific event.
  The event can include any number of arguments that will be passed to the listeners.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `eventName` | EventName | - |
  | `args` | Parameters<indexedAccess> | - |

- `generateThumbnailsAsync(times: number | number[], options?: VideoThumbnailOptions): Promise<VideoThumbnail[]>`
  Generates thumbnails from the currently played asset. The thumbnails are references to native images,
  thus they can be used as a source of the `Image` component from `expo-image`.
  Available on platforms: android, ios
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `times` | number \| number[] | - |
  | `options` *(optional)* | VideoThumbnailOptions | - |

- `listenerCount(eventName: EventName): number`
  Returns a number of listeners added to the given event.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `eventName` | EventName | - |

- `pause()`
  Pauses the player.

- `play()`
  Resumes the player.

- `release()`
  A function that detaches the JS and native objects to let the native object deallocate
  before the JS object gets deallocated by the JS garbage collector. Any subsequent calls to native
  functions of the object will throw an error as it is no longer associated with its native counterpart.

  In most cases, you should never need to use this function, except some specific performance-critical cases when
  manual memory management makes sense and the native object is known to exclusively retain some native memory
  (such as binary data or image bitmap). Before calling this function, you should ensure that nothing else will use
  this object later on. Shared objects created by React hooks are usually automatically released in the effect's cleanup phase,
  for example: `useVideoPlayer()` from `expo-video` and `useImage()` from `expo-image`.

- `removeAllListeners(eventName: typeOperator)`
  Removes all listeners for the given event name.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `eventName` | typeOperator | - |

- `removeListener(eventName: EventName, listener: indexedAccess)`
  Removes a listener for the given event name.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `eventName` | EventName | - |
  | `listener` | indexedAccess | - |

- `replace(source: VideoSource, disableWarning?: boolean)`
  Replaces the current source with a new one.

  > On iOS, this method loads the asset data synchronously on the UI thread and can block it for extended periods of time.
  > Use `replaceAsync` to load the asset asynchronously and avoid UI lags.

  > This method will be deprecated in the future.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `source` | VideoSource | - |
  | `disableWarning` *(optional)* | boolean | - |

- `replaceAsync(source: VideoSource): Promise<void>`
  Replaces the current source with a new one, while offloading loading of the asset to a different thread.

  > On Android and Web, this method is equivalent to `replace`.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `source` | VideoSource | - |

- `replay()`
  Seeks the playback to the beginning.

- `seekBy(seconds: number)`
  Seeks the playback by the given number of seconds. The time to which the player seeks may differ from the specified requested time for efficiency,
  depending on the encoding and what is currently buffered by the player. Use this function to implement playback controls that seek by specific amount of time,
  in which case, the actual time usually does not have to be precise. For frame accurate seeking, use the [`currentTime`](#currenttime) property.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `seconds` | number | - |

- `startObserving(eventName: EventName)`
  Function that is automatically invoked when the first listener for an event with the given name is added.

- `stopObserving(eventName: EventName)`
  Function that is automatically invoked when the last listener for an event with the given name is removed.
  Override it in a subclass to perform some additional cleanup once the event is no longer observed.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `eventName` | EventName | - |
